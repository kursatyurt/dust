## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO DUST! 

Thanks for taking interest in DUST! 

We hope it will prove to be useful to you, but as any human product
it is fated with imperfections. That is why we would like to hear from
you, to create a better solution for you, for us and for all the users.

For suggestions and discussions you can simply reach out to the [developers contributors](contributors.md).

If you are using the code and you stumble upon a bug, we will try to 
address the issue as soon as possible! Please open an issue. 

If you want to code some features yourself, add some functionalities or
simply mess with the code, you are encouraged to fork the official 
repository <https://public.gitlab.polimi.it/DAER/dust> and play around with it. 
When you are ready with your modification and feature, open a merge request! 

If you want to keep your code up to date with the official repository,
remember to mirror your fork with respect to the original repository.

An advice, modify your code on another branch, since the master branch
will be updated from the original repository, creating conflicts or 
possibly ereasing your work (depending on the mirroring settings).

If you think your contribution should be included in the official 
repository file a merge request from gitlab: 

  <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork>

we will consider your contribution for the following releases.

Note that it is unlikely that merge request will be accepted as-it-is
and merged into the official repository, the modifications will be 
included in our development and testing flow, and included in a future 
release, however we will keep you updated on the status of the 
integration of your contribution. 

If you want your contribution to be homogeneous with the rest of the code, 
check out the code style guide in the doc/ folder!

We are looking forward to hear from you!

The developers of DUST.
