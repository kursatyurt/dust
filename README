DUST comprises a solver, a preprocessor and a post processor.

The preprocessor accepts meshes in CGNS format or in simple point-connectivity
definition, or builds the geometry from parametric definitions.

The whole geometry generated by the preprocessor, alongside the definition
of reference frames and their motion is the input of the solver, that 
calculates the solution and generates the results.

The results are then employed by the postprocessor which elaborates the data
according to the user requests.

For the installation of DUST see INSTALL 


COMPATIBILITY:
DUST was tested under:
  * Ubuntu 16.04
    * gcc 5.4.0 and Ifort 18.0.1
    * hdf5 1.8.16 and hdf5 1.10.2
    * cgns 3.3.1 (3.1.4 works but has a different API and requires code modification)

  * Ubuntu 18.04
    * gcc 7.3.0
    * hdf5 1.10.2
    * cgns 3.3.1

  * CentOS
    * gcc 4.8.5
    * hdf5 1.10.2
    * cgns 3.3.1

DOCUMENTATION:
 the source code is commented to be automatically documented with Doxygen.
 To create the documentation:
 cd src
 doxygen Doxyfile

 the documentation should be stored in the doc folder
 in html the documentation can be read and searched opening index.html in a web
 browser
 in latex the latex sources can be compiled by employing make, which would 
 generate the manual in refman.pdf
