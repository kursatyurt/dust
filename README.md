## Overview

DUST comprises a solver, a preprocessor and a post processor.

The preprocessor accepts meshes in CGNS format or in simple point-connectivity
definition, or builds the geometry from parametric definitions.

The whole geometry generated by the preprocessor, alongside the definition
of reference frames and their motion is the input of the solver, that 
calculates the solution and generates the results.

The results are then employed by the postprocessor which elaborates the data
according to the user requests.

## Documentation

The source code is commented to be automatically documented with Doxygen.
To create the documentation:
cd src
doxygen Doxyfile

The documentation should be stored in the doc folder in html the documentation can be
read and searched opening index.html in a web browser in latex the latex sources can be
compiled by employing make, which would generate the manual in refman.pdf.

In the doc folder can be found a **quick_start.pdf** containing a description of the provided examples.
