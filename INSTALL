REQUIREMENTS:
 to build dust are required:
 * A Fortran compiler
 * CMake
 * A Lapack/BLAS implementation
 * An HDF5 library
 * A CGNS library

A Fortran compiler, CMake and a Lapack implementation can be found pre-packed 
in most linux distributions.

HDF5 can be found packed in many distribution. 
However it can be easily built with the following procedure:
  * clone the desired version of HDF5 fromt the git repositories:
    git clone -b hdf5_1_10_2 https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/scm/hdffv/hdf5.git
  
  * move into the folder, and build an install folder
    cd hdf5
    mkdir install

  *configure the installation
    ./configure --prefix=./install --enable-fortran

  *build & install
    make
    make install

CGNS can be found packed in some distributions, however tends to be outdated, 
and since CGNS tend to change radically the API behaviour it is advised to
build it from the git repositories
  * clone the stable release from the git repositories
    git clone -b master https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS.git

  * move into folder, create the installation folders
    cd CGNS
    mkdir build install
    cd build

  * configure the installation
    export HDF5_ROOT=/path/to/hdf5/installation (should not be necessary when employing system libraries)
    cmake -D CGNS_ENABLE_FORTRAN=ON -D CGNS_ENABLE_HDF5=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../

  * build & install
    make 
    make install


Build instructions for DUST:
1) create a build folder inside this folder (can be "build" or anything else)
2) move to the build directory
3) ccmake ../  and configure (change values, c to configure iteratively, g to generate makefile)
   -> If a specific compiler is required, use instead
      ccmake -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort ../   for example
   -> If a specific HDF5 implementation is used, export the variable
      export HDF5_ROOT=/path/to/hdf5/root before calling ccmake
   -> If a specific cgns implementation is used, set the appropriate paths
4) make
5) The executable should be in build/bin
