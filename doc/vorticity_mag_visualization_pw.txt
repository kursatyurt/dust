	Filters -> ComputeDerivatives
		Vectors: velocity
		Output Vector Type: Vorticity
		Output Tensor Type: Vector Gradient
	Filters -> CellDataToPointData
	Filters -> Calculator
		Attribute Type: Point Data
		Result Array Name: Vorticity_mag
		Operation: mag(Vorticity)
	Filters -> Contour
		Contour By: Vorticity_mag
		flag -> Compute Normals & Generate Triangles

At the end activate the visibility only on Contour.
NOTE: if visualization appears to coarse (separated blobs and isolated particles) try to increase the slicing of your 3d box (Nxyz).
