This is the increasing list of the debug levels, for reference.

Generally debug levels 1-10 add terminal output, levels 11-99 add file output
and levels >100 alter the execution of the program (stop at certain locations)

All the levels are CUMULATIVE (i.e. a certain level produced also ALL the lower
levels effects)

level    effect
0        Almost no screen output

1        Minimal Screen output (default)

3        Detailed info output with timing

5        Extended verbose screen output

7        Extra warning, can lead to potential false negative warnings

8        Super extra verbose output

15       print out files with debug geometry details at the beginning of the 
         simulation

16       print out files with debug geometry at each timestep

20       print out the array of debug linear system results

50       dump the whole linear system
