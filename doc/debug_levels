This is the increasing list of the debug levels, for reference.

Generally debug levels 1-10 add terminal output, levels 11-99 add file output
and levels >100 alter the execution of the program (stop at certain locations)

All the levels are CUMULATIVE (i.e. a certain level produced also ALL the lower
levels effects)

level    effect
1        standard detailed info output with timing

3        Extended info output

15       print out files with debug geometry details at the beginning of the 
         simulation

16       print out files with debug geometry at each timestep

17       print out debug wake data

20       print out the array of debug linear system results

50       dump the whole linear system
