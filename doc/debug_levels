This is the increasing list of the debug levels, for reference.

Generally debug levels 1-10 add terminal output, levels 11-99 add file output
and levels >100 alter the execution of the program (stop at certain locations)

All the levels are CUMULATIVE (i.e. a certain level produced also ALL the lower
levels effects)

level    effect
1        standard detailed info output

15       print out files with geometry details

20       print out the array of linear system results

50       dump the whole linear system
