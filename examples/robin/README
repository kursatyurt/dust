More complex case  employing a number of different features, from restart to 
vortex particle method and fast multipole.

To execute copy or link the executables, and then 

./dust_pre
./dust
./dust_post

The geometry is created, then the simulation is restarted from a previous result
and advanced in time.

Finally visualizations and loads are computed
