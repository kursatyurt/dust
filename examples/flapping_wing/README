Simple test case to showcase the possibilities of reference frames motion and
different types of postprocessing.

As usual, copy or link the executables in the present folder, and execute

./dust_pre
./dust
./dust_post

In dust_post.in different postprocessing analysis are requested: visualizations,
flowfield visualizations and integral loads. 

While surface visualizations and flowfield visualization produce vtk files, the 
integral load analyses produce .dat files with the time history of the loads.

All type of analysis can also be generated in tecplot format editing the 
dust_post.in input files.
