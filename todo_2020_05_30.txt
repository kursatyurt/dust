TODO list:
#7   define the extension of the ailerons in the streamwise direction
#9a  check time advance w/o precice, since it skips dt. (DONE)
     *** dirty *** check if the increment of dt counter could be moved in the
     same place (begin/end) of the time loop for both coupled/uncoupled code
#11  Test model with both rigid and ll coupling
#12  Clean mbdynAdapter.py and mbdynInterface.py. Remove hardcoded parameters
     and read them from files, instead.
#14  Clean mbdynAdapter and mod_precice module in dust to avoid verbose 
     screen output used for debug, during implementation
#15  In geo/mod_build_geo.f90, check if t_te rotation is required only for
     'rigid' coupling
#16  In geo/mod_build_geo.f90, check if coupling_node might be a dummy input
     for 'll' coupling (l.676-8)
#17  Check in mod_hinges.f90, read_hinge_nodes(): n_nodes = n_nodes - 1, after
     reading n_nodes?
#18  Check nodes numbering in precice rbf coupling: %i_points_precice, %rbf%ind
#19  Compute pressure for v and p elements, in dust.f90
#20  Add 'small_displacement' option for coupled components, in order to assign
     b.c. by transpiration, without moving the geometry and refactorizing the
     linear system.

#A   Implement general coupling
#B   Implement hinge coupling

DONE list:
#1   fix TE bug with moving hinges. First wake elements look to drift towards
     the LE, w/o being coincident with the TE of the geometrical component
     (occurring only when the component has Moving = F, and incremental update
     of theta is used, see #2)
#2   make hinge_deflection consistent for components with Moving = T ( with 
     non-incremental update no bug appears? ) and Moving = F ( incremental update?
     Find the bug! )
#3   update velocity of the elem centers due to hinge motion.
#4   make all the solver and postprocessor ooutput process consistent with the
     output_detailed_geo = T option available in dust.in
     e.g. in dust_post: if Components/rr present in hdf5 file, read rr, w/o
     re-constructing the motion
#5   update linear system construction, to handle components with Motion = F
     but moving hinges. Are #5 and #3 enough to get the right results?
#6   check load evaluation on surface panel and vortex lattice, due to hinge rotation.
     Start with integral loads, VL steady. Bug-fix: wrong update of el%dn_dt
#8   linear interpolation of the aileron regions to avoid sharp discontinuities
     w/ the fixed part of the component
#9   check time advance w/o precice, since it skips dt. *** dirty ? ***
(#10)  hinge output with precice, even if there is no hinge.
       Group not saved in .hdf5 files with Coupling_Type = ll (only?), but postpro
       tries to read it.
       It was an illusion, produced by the presence in the same folder of old
       result files along with the new ones.
#13  dust_post not working while dust is running. _geo.h5 file busy. hdf5 hinge
     groups were not closed, after writing hinge fields.
#21  Bugfix needed for rbf coupling w/ particle wake. Something wrong in 
     t_precice % update_near_wake()?
     Bugfix: %uvort was not set to zero, before computing it.
#22  Fix "step behavior" of the 3rd row of points of wake panels, when
     ndt_update_wake .ne. 1
