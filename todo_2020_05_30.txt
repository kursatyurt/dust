TODO list:
#7   define the extension of the ailerons in the streamwise direction
#9   check time advance w/o precice, since it skips dt
#10  hinge output with precice, even if there is no hinge.
     Group not saved in .hdf5 files with Coupling_Type = ll (only?), but postpro
     tries to read it
#11  Test model with both rigid and ll coupling
#12  Clean mbdynAdapter.py and mbdynInterface.py. Remove hardcoded parameters
     and read them from files, instead.

#A   Implement general coupling
#B   Implement hinge coupling

DONE list:
#1   fix TE bug with moving hinges. First wake elements looks to drift towards
     the LE, w/o being coincidente with the TE of the geometrical component
     (occurring only when the component has Moving = F, and incremental update
     of theta is used, see #2)
#2   make hinge_deflection consistent for components with Moving = T ( with 
     non-incremental update no bug appears? ) and Moving = F ( incremental update?
     Find the bug! )
#3   update velocity of the elem centers due to hinge motion.
#4   make all the solver and postprocessor ooutput process consistent with the
     output_detailed_geo = T option available in dust.in
     e.g. in dust_post: if Components/rr present in hdf5 file, read rr, w/o
     re-constructing the motion
#5   update linear system construction, to handle components with Motion = F
     but moving hinges. Are #5 and #3 enough to get the right results?
#6   check load evaluation on surface panel and vortex lattice, due to hinge rotation.
     Start with integral loads, VL steady. Bug-fix: wrong update of el%dn_dt
#8   linear interpolation of the aileron regions to avoid sharp discontinuities
     w/ the fixed part of the component
