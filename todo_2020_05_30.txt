TODO list:


DONE list:
#1 fix TE bug with moving hinges. First wake elements looks to drift towards
  the LE, w/o being coincidente with the TE of the geometrical component
  (occurring only when the component has Moving = F, and incremental update
  of theta is used, see #2)
#2 make hinge_deflection consistent for components with Moving = T ( with 
  non-incremental update no bug appears? ) and Moving = F ( incremental update?
  Find the bug! )
#3 update velocity of the elem centers due to hinge motion.
#4 make all the solver and postprocessor ooutput process consistent with the
  output_detailed_geo = T option available in dust.in
  e.g. in dust_post: if Components/rr present in hdf5 file, read rr, w/o
  re-constructing the motion
#5 update linear system construction, to handle components with Motion = F
  but moving hinges. Are #5 and #3 enough to get the right results?
