TODO list:
- fix TE bug with moving hinges. First wake elements looks to drift towards
  the LE, w/o being coincidente with the TE of the geometrical component
- update velocity of the elem centers due to hinge motion
- make all the solver and postprocessor ooutput process consistent with the
  output_detailed_geo = T option available in dust.in
  e.g. in dust_post: if Components/rr present in hdf5 file, read rr, w/o
  re-constructing the motion
