=== Coupling dust/MBDyn w/ PreCICE ===
> mod_build_geo.f90/build_component()
  So far, coupling implmented only for parametric components.
  TODO: make coupling available also for other types of components
> mod_build_geo.f90/build_component() / component.in
  So far, CouplingNode is defined in the component reference frame,
  that is meant to be coincident with the global reference frame

> TODO: parallel loops in coupling routines

> Restart for coupled simulation
  So far, no restart is implemented, since our target dynamical 
  solver (MBDyn) has no restart capability (at least, a working 
  restart).
  ...
  Restart could be implemented, exploiting PreCICE write_initial_data
  for communicating aerodynamic restart data to the structural solver,
  but up to now there is no way to pass position and rotation to 
  MBDyn (MBDyn passes position and rotation and reads forces and
  moments)

> Moment contributions to loads in mod_precice.f90/update_force()
  So far, the contribution to the moment of the elementary forces
  is not implemented.
