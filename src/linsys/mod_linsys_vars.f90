!> Type containing all the data necessary to solve the linear system
!! for the aerodynamic elements doublets intensities
type :: t_linsys
 
 !> Rank of the linear system
 integer :: rank
 
 !> Linear system matrix
 real(wp), allocatable :: A(:,:)

 !> Linear system right hand side
 real(wp), allocatable :: b(:)

 !> Linear system matrix (for pressure integral equation)
 real(wp), allocatable :: A_pres(:,:)
 
 !> Linear system right hand side (for pressure integral equation)

 !> LU solvers pivot permutation matrix (in vector form)
 integer, allocatable :: P(:)
 integer, allocatable :: P_pres(:)
 
 !> Static part of the right hand side
 !!
 !! The right hand side contains contributions from all the surface panels.
 !! The contributions from surface panels that do not actually move can be 
 !! calculated just once, than multiplied for the freestream velocity and 
 !! finally the contribution of the moving panels is added 
 real(wp), allocatable :: b_static(:,:)

 !> static part for integral equation (for pressure integral equation)
 real(wp), allocatable :: b_static_pres(:,:) ! not strictly required
 ! OSS -> b_static_pres = b_static(1:idSurfPan_static , 1:idSurfPan_static )
 ! OSS    with idSurfPan_static = idSurfPan(1:nstatic_SurfPan)

 !> Static part of the lifting line contribution
 !!
 !! The contribution of the lifting line is similar to wake contribution,
 !! however a part could be static on static and can be pre-computed
 real(wp), allocatable :: L_static(:,:)

 !> Static part of the actuator disk contribution
 !!
 !! The contribution of the actuator disk is similar to wake contribution,
 !! however a part could be static on static and can be pre-computed
